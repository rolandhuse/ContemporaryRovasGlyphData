# Supplementary GlyphData for Contemporary Rovas (Old Hungarian)

This is a GlyphData.xml file for use with [Glyphs 3](https://glyphsapp.com). It contains the 15 new additions in the Unicode proposal for a Rovas update, a.k.a. ‘Rovás code chart for Contemporary Use Extended Hungarian Alphabet’. For details, see [Rovás kódolási segédlet / Guide to Rovas font encoding](http://rovas.info/rovas-encoding/).

## Installation

* To use in all your files: Move the GlyphData.xml file to `˜/Library/Application Support/Glyphs 3/Info/`.
* To use only in certain files: Move the XML file either in the same folder as the .glyphs file, or in a subfolder called `Info`.

Either way, you may need to restart the app for changes to take effect.
